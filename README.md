# Code-Compression-for-Embedded-Systems

This project implement both code compression and decompression for Embedded Systems.

Assume that the dictionary can have eight entries (index 3 bits) and the eight entries are selected based on frequency (the most frequent instruction should have index 000). 

You are allowed to use only the following seven possible formats for compression. 



Command Line and Input/Output Formats: The simulator should be executed with the following command line. Please use parameters “1” and “2” to indicate compression, and decompression, respectively.
> ./SIM 1 (or java SIM 1) for compression
> ./SIM 2 (or java SIM 2) for decompression
